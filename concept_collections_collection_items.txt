We have Pages, Collections and Collection items.
Pages are managed in a tree structure.
Collections and their items are decoupled from Pages.

Definition of collections and collection items

	Each collection
		- must be defined in the backend via a collection interface
		- has a route that is used as a starting point for the route of any item in it (e.g. /blog/)
		- has a route pattern for its items e.g. /{publishedDate|date('Y')}/{slug}
		- has a layout where its items and other components are rendered
		- holds instances of collection items ordered by date published DESC
		- can be integrated (displayed) in the frontend via Menus.
		- may have custom filters for browsing the collection (handled via Cake Event callbacks)

	Each collection item
		- must be defined in the backend via an item interface
		  In this interface you can
		  	- give the collection item a name
		  	- create field groups
		  	- assign predefined fields to a group with
		  		- their own name (array key)
		  		- their own label (for the form)
		  		- their own hint text (for the form)
	  		- can assign custom fields (TODO: clarify how this can be implemented, maybe custom classes or event callbacks)
	  		- change the position (order) of field groups
	  		- change the position (order) of a field in a group
	  		- drag and drop a field from one group to another
	  		-> the group assignment and position of a field has only an influence on where the field is displayed when adding/editing a collection item instance

	  	- can be made available to 1 or more collections
	  	- has a short layout for display within a collection page
	  	- has a detail layout for the detail view
